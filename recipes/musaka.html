    <p>I learned this musaka from my Bulgarian mother-in-law though it's probably Turkish in origin. 
      The recipe calls for chubritsa, a Bulgarian herb that can be difficult to find in the States, 
      so basil can be used in its place.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped summer savory (chubritsa)</li>
      <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
      <li>â…” cup yogurt</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef 
        in hot oil until crumbly and evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with paprika, 
        cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in potatoes and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato 
        sauce and summer savory. Pour in enough water to just barely cover. Reduce heat and 
        simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour meat mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and spread evenly. Mix together 
        yogurt and beaten egg in a small bowl; spread over meat mixture to cover.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
