    <p>For this satisfying dish, cabbage leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice, 
      ground beef, pork and ham. They are then laid on a bed of sauerkraut and simmered to 
      completion. This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I've ever tried.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>½ pound ground ham</li>
      <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
      <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
      <li>water to cover</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, 
        take it out to thaw.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, 
        salt and pepper. Mix well. Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the 
        mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.
      </li>
      <li>Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, 
        placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. 
        Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water 
        as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
