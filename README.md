HTML Project

In this project, I will be demonstrating my ability with HTML by creating multiple HTML files 
that incorporate a variety of content, including images, unordered and ordered lists, and 
paragraphs of text.

One of the goals of this project is to learn how to link these HTML files together using relative 
links, creating a cohesive website with multiple pages.

Throughout this project, I will be using my knowledge of HTML to showcase my ability to 
create visually appealing and functional web pages.
